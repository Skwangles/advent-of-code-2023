## About
Advent of Code is an Advent calendar of small programming puzzles for a variety of skill sets and skill levels that can be solved in any programming language you like. 
People use them as interview prep, company training, university coursework, practice problems, a speed contest, or to challenge each other.

Problems come in 2 parts, the 2nd is only available after solving part 1.
The first part is usually a simplified, or easier, problem which can give a hint where to start to solve part 2.

## How I did it
I have primarily used Python, however, for funzies I thought I'd subject myself to C++ and give that a go.

## How do I use them?
Please don't, the whole fun is solving it yourself. 

I have made no effort to retain the ability to solve part 1, I instead used its corpse to solve part 2.
Part 1 functionality of the code can likely be recovered by undoing some of the Part 2 functionality. 

## Quality

The following are the scripts/programs I've made for fun, not overly trying to optimise or make traditionally 'pretty' code.
When I'm actively producing and developing code for a professional environment a lot more care is taken.
